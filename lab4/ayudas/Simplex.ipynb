    "# What is the simplex algorithm?\n",
    "\n",
    "The simplex algorithm is a method for solving linear programming problems. It was developed by George Dantzig in 1947. The simplex algorithm is an iterative procedure for finding the optimal solution to a linear programming problem. The simplex algorithm operates on a feasible solution to the problem, and moves from one feasible solution to another until the optimal solution is reached."

    "## When to use the simplex algorithm?\n",
    "\n",
    "The simplex algorithm is used to solve linear programming problems. A linear programming problem is a mathematical optimization problem in which a linear objective function is maximized or minimized subject to a set of linear constraints. The simplex algorithm is used to solve linear programming problems in which the objective function and constraints are linear."

    "## Types of Simplex Algorithms\n",
    "\n",
    "The Simplex algorithm is a powerful method used for solving linear programming problems. Depending on the nature of the problem and the specific requirements for computational efficiency, various versions of the Simplex algorithm can be employed. Here, we focus on differentiating the key variants of the Simplex algorithm, with a special emphasis on the primal and tabular approaches.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Primal Simplex Algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "The **Primal Simplex Algorithm** is the classic form of the Simplex method, designed primarily for problems where the objective function is to be maximized. This approach starts with a feasible solution at a vertex of the feasible region and moves along the edges of the region to adjacent vertices with higher objective function values until no further improvements are possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Key Characteristics**: Directly tackles the original form of the linear programming problem.\n",
    "- **Typical Use**: Most effective when starting with a basic feasible solution that is easy to identify and the problem is set up with inequalities typically less than or equal to (≤).\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Dual Simplex Algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "The **Dual Simplex Algorithm** operates under the same principles as the primal simplex but applies them in reverse. It is used predominantly for problems where the objective function is to be minimized. This method is particularly useful when the initial solution is dual feasible but not necessarily primal feasible.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Key Characteristics**: It starts with the dual feasibility and moves towards primal feasibility, making it suitable for problems that begin with an infeasible primal solution but a feasible dual.\n",
    "- **Typical Use**: Ideal for situations where modifications to a linear programming problem invalidate the primal feasibility of an existing solution but maintain its dual feasibility.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Revised Simplex Algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "The **Revised Simplex Algorithm** is an optimization of the primal simplex method, designed to handle large-scale problems more efficiently. This variant modifies the data handling and computational steps of the primal simplex method to reduce computational overhead, especially in terms of memory usage and processing time.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Key Characteristics**: Utilizes a different data structure (often a sparse matrix format) to store the tableau, updating only necessary parts of the tableau in each iteration.\n",
    "- **Typical Use**: Best for large-scale problems where memory and computational efficiency are crucial.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Tabular Simplex Algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "The **Tabular Simplex Algorithm**, also known as the Simplex Tableau method, is a structured tabular approach to the primal simplex method. It uses a tableau format to systematically perform and track computations across iterations.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Key Characteristics**: All operations (including pivot operations) are performed within a single tableau, which is updated iteratively. This approach provides a clear and organized way to trace the algorithm's progress.\n",
    "- **Typical Use**: Highly favored in educational settings for teaching the simplex method and in situations where tracking detailed step-by-step changes is beneficial.\n"
